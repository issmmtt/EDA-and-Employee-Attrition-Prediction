# About 
In business, employee attrition is when employees leave the company for whatever reason, either they've found a new job or retired, and haven't been replaced immediately.<br><br>

For a company to be successful, it needs not only to attract top talent but it also needs to retain these talents. For this reason, I have the job to look into a dataset containing information regarding a certain company's employee list to try to find patterns that may provide useful information in understanding why employees leave.<br><br>

In this notebook, I first treated the data, looking for missing values and attributing names for categorical variables that were previously labeled as numbers.<br><br>

After doing so, I used Plotly lib for data visualization, which drives us to conclusions and helps us find patterns among employee attrition. <br><br>

For building a classification model, I have split the data into training a testing sets and did all treatment necessary such as variable encoding, rescaling features, and dealing with imbalanced classes. 
Lastly, I performed a search for the best hyperparameters setting and tested the models again, trying to achieve better scores.<br><br>

# Conclusion

Through RandomizedSearchCV, we could improve the accuracy score for the Gradient Boosting Classifier, scoring 88.44%, the highest among all models.<br><br>


Yet, the first Ada Boost Classifier model maintained the best recall score of 62.69%, correctly predicting the largest amount of employees who were more likely to leave, while having a good accuracy score (87.53%). After tuning Ada Boost, we reached an 83.58% recall score, but we lost a lot of accuracy and had a large increase in false positives, possibly indicating that the algorithm became biased towards identifying employees as likely to leave most of the time.<br><br>

# Kaggle 

I originally posted this notebook to Kaggle, where Plotly graphs are interactive. I highly suggest you <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/code/lusfernandotorres/eda-and-employee-attrition-prediction/notebook">click here</a> to see this project on Kaggle and I'd love it if you leave a comment and an upvote. <br><br>
I appreciate suggestions and recommendations that may help me improve my work :) <br><br>

Thank you so much!
